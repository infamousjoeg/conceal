```go
import "github.com/infamousjoeg/conceal/pkg/conceal/keychain"
```

The keychain package provides a unified interface for interacting with native OS credential stores across platforms.

#### Platform Support
- **macOS**: Uses Security Framework and Keychain Access
- **Windows**: Uses Windows Credential Manager API
- **Other platforms**: Returns appropriate error messages

#### Functions

##### func AddSecret

```go
func AddSecret(secretID string, secret []byte) error
```
AddSecret stores a secret in the platform's native credential store. Returns an error if the secret already exists or if the operation fails.

**Platform behavior:**
- **macOS**: Stores in Keychain with service "summon"
- **Windows**: Stores in Credential Manager with target "summon/{secretID}"

##### func DeleteSecret

```go
func DeleteSecret(secretID string) error
```
DeleteSecret removes a secret from the platform's credential store. Returns an error if the secret doesn't exist or removal fails.

##### func GetSecret

```go
func GetSecret(secretID string, delivery string) error
```
GetSecret retrieves a secret and delivers it via the specified method:
- `"clipboard"`: Copies to clipboard for 15 seconds with auto-clear
- `"stdout"`: Prints to standard output (for Summon integration)

##### func ListSecrets

```go
func ListSecrets() []QueryResult
```
ListSecrets returns all Summon-compatible secrets from the credential store.

```go
type QueryResult struct {
    Account string  // The secret identifier
}
```

##### func SecretExists

```go
func SecretExists(secretID string) bool
```
SecretExists checks if a secret exists in the credential store without retrieving its value.

##### func UpdateSecret

```go
func UpdateSecret(secretID string, secret []byte) error
```
UpdateSecret modifies an existing secret's value. Returns an error if the secret doesn't exist.

### clipboard Package

```go
import "github.com/infamousjoeg/conceal/pkg/conceal/clipboard"
```

The clipboard package provides secure clipboard management with automatic clearing.

#### Functions

##### func Secret

```go
func Secret(secret string)
```
Secret copies the provided string to the system clipboard and automatically clears it after 15 seconds. If a signal interrupt (Ctrl+C) is detected, the clipboard is immediately cleared for security.

**Cross-platform support:**
- **macOS**: Uses `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` via atotto/clipboard
- **Windows**: Uses Windows Clipboard API via atotto/clipboard
- **Linux**: Uses xclip/xsel via atotto/clipboard

##### func SetupCloseHandler

```go
func SetupCloseHandler()
```
SetupCloseHandler creates a signal handler that listens for OS interrupts (SIGTERM, SIGINT) and immediately clears the clipboard when received. This ensures secrets are not left in the clipboard if the application is terminated unexpectedly.

## Concept

### Why Choose Conceal for Your Secret Management Needs?

In modern software development, securely managing secrets (such as API keys, passwords, and other sensitive data) is crucial. Conceal, developed by Joe Garcia, is a powerful utility designed to simplify and secure the management of these secrets. Here‚Äôs why you should consider using Conceal:

#### **Leverage Existing Tools**
**"Why not use what the OS provides?"**
- Conceal allows developers to use built-in OS credential stores (macOS Keychain and Windows Credential Manager) to manage secrets without needing to set up dedicated secrets management infrastructure initially. This means you can start development immediately without additional setup overhead or cloud dependencies.

#### **Seamless Integration with Summon**
- Conceal works seamlessly with Summon, a tool that injects secrets as environment variables into your applications. This allows for easy transitioning between different environments without changing the code. As you move from development to staging to production, the secrets provider can change without any code modification, enhancing flexibility and security.

#### **Establish Secure Coding Practices Early**
**"You're establishing secure coding habits by starting development using environment variables out of the gate."**
- By using Conceal and Summon together, you adopt best practices from the start. Managing secrets via environment variables is a secure method that avoids hardcoding sensitive information in your application code, thus preventing technical debt and security vulnerabilities.

#### **Avoid Technical Debt**
**"...instead of creating technical debt that then becomes a problem later on down the line when a secrets manager needs to be baked into it."**
- Starting with good practices means you won't need to refactor your code later to integrate a secrets manager. Conceal helps avoid this costly and time-consuming process by providing a secure solution from the beginning.

#### **Cost-Effective Solution**
**"Free or overpay, which do you choose?"**
- Conceal leverages free, existing tools, avoiding the need for expensive enterprise secrets management solutions. This makes it a cost-effective choice, especially for startups and small teams.

### Key Features of Conceal

1. **Cross-Platform**: Native support for macOS Keychain and Windows Credential Manager
2. **Local Development-Friendly**: Ideal for local development environments without cloud dependencies
3. **Ease of Use**: Simple, consistent CLI commands across all supported platforms
4. **Security**: Leverages OS-native encryption and access controls
5. **Summon Integration**: Seamless compatibility with CyberArk Summon for environment injection
6. **Zero Configuration**: Works immediately after installation with no setup required

### How to Get Started with Conceal

1. **Install Conceal**: Follow the instructions in the [Conceal GitHub repository](https://github.com/infamousjoeg/conceal) to install the utility.
2. **Set Secrets**: Use the `conceal set` command to securely store your secrets.
3. **Retrieve Secrets**: Integrate with Summon to retrieve secrets as environment variables in your application.

### Conclusion

Conceal is a powerful and useful utility for any developer looking to securely manage secrets without incurring additional setup costs or creating technical debt. By integrating with existing tools and promoting secure practices from the start, Conceal ensures your development process remains efficient, secure, and cost-effective.
